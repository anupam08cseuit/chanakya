<h3>About School</h3>
<p>
Chanakya International School is situated in Manu ka pura , Uruwa, Meja at Mirzapur road NH 35. It was felt need to establish an English medium school in this very locality, where a child gets the chance for total development of his/her personality, without any discrimination of caste, creed or culture. Chanakya International School is a co-educational English medium school established and administered under the aegis of Rama Memorial Foundation . Currently we are open to accept applications for classes from ‘nursery to class V’, in academic year 2021-22 and it will be full pledged school upto class XII.
